# 3DSensorimotorObstacleAvoidance

Final Project, University of Bristol, MSc Robotics



Sonar based robots mostly use deliberate control system which requires environment reconstruction. Greater demands were placed on the sensing accuracy and computational resources by complex environments. A sonar based bio-mimetic sensorimotor model was proposed to perform obstacle avoidance in 2D plane, showing a great potential to be implemented in flying robots or mobile robots to improve performance in complex environments. It did not require environment reconstruction and proved that Interaural Intensity Differences in first millisecond of echo train was sufficient for obstacle avoidance. The model was robust with low latency in complex environments. The project managed to extend the model from 2D to 3D by adding elevation rotation in it. A target search function was also added to test the capacity of obstacle avoidance in a more realistic and functional situation. The evaluation results indicated the model was capable of both reaching the target and avoiding obstacles with a minimal number of collisions.
